# digiposte-go-sdk

This repository contains the Go SDK for the [Digiposte](https://digiposte.fr) API.

It is a work in progress, and all the API endpoints are not implemented yet.

## Authentication

The sdk delegates the authentication to the http client. So it must be configured to add the authentication headers to the requests.
